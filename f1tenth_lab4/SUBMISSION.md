My gap-following algorithm works fluently in the levine-blocked map. For the obs map, there is one place where my algorithm failed. It failed at the top-right corner because the obstacles blocked most of the correct way to the left. When the robot passes that place, it will turn right, and then it no longer has the knowledge to turn left.
